        "#THEORATICAL QUESTION\n",
        "1. What is the difference between a function and a method in Python ?\n",
        "  - **Functions:**\n",
        "  - **Definition:** A function is a block of code designed to perform a specific task.\n",
        "  - **Calling: **Functions are called by name, like my_function(argument1, argument2).\n",
        "  - **Scope**: Functions can be defined outside of any class, making them independent.\n",
        "  - **Data:** Functions can take data as input (parameters) and can return data (return value).\n",
        "  - **Methods:**\n",
        "  - **Definition:** A method is a function that is defined within a class and is associated with an object (instance of a class).\n",
        "  - **Calling:** Methods are called using dot notation, e.g., my_object.my_method(argument1, argument2).\n",
        "  - **Scope:** Methods are always defined inside a class and are linked to the objects of that class.\n",
        "  - **Data:** Methods are implicitly passed the object on which they are called as the first argument (conventionally named self).\n",
        "\n",
        "2. Explain the concept of function arguments and parameters in Python.\n",
        "    - **Parameters:** These are the variables defined within the parentheses of a function definition (e.g., def my_function(parameter1, parameter2):).\n",
        "They act as placeholders for the values that will be used inside the function.\n",
        "Think of them as the names of the boxes where the function will store the input data.\n",
        "    - **Arguments:**\n",
        "These are the values that are passed to the function when it's called (e.g., my_function(value1, value2)).\n",
        "They provide the actual data that the function will work with.\n",
        "Think of them as the data that gets put into the boxes (parameters).\n",
        "\n",
        "3. What are the different ways to define and call a function in Python ?\n",
        "  - In Python, you define functions using the def keyword, followed by the function name, parentheses for potential arguments, and a colon, then indent the function body. To call a function, simply use its name followed by parentheses, optionally with arguments.\n",
        "\n",
        "4.  What is the purpose of the `return` statement in a Python function ?\n",
        "  - The return statement in a Python function serves to terminate the function's execution and send a value back to the caller. This allows the function's output to be used or stored for further processing.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. What are iterators in Python and how do they differ from iterables?\n",
        "  - Here is a list of the differences between Iterable and Iterator in Python. An Iterable is basically an object that any user can iterate over. An Iterator is also an object that helps a user in iterating over another object (that is iterable). We can generate an iterator when we pass the object to the iter() method.\n",
        "\n",
        "6. Explain the concept of generators in Python and how they are defined.\n",
        "  - In Python, a generator is a function that returns an iterator that produces a sequence of values when iterated over.\n",
        "\n",
        "  - Generators are useful when we want to produce a large sequence of values, but we don't want to store all of them in memory at once.\n",
        "\n",
        "  - **Create Python Generator**\n",
        "  - In Python, similar to defining a normal function, we can define a generator function using the def keyword, but instead of the return statement we use the yield statement.\n",
        "  - When the generator function is called, it does not execute the function body immediately. Instead, it returns a generator object that can be iterated over to produce the values.\n",
        "\n",
        "7. What are the advantages of using generators over regular functions ?\n",
        "  - Unlike a regular function, a generator does not return its results all at once. Instead, it yields its values one by one, each time it is called. This makes it possible to generate an infinite sequence of values, as long as there is sufficient memory to store them.\n",
        "\n",
        "8. What is a lambda function in Python and when is it typically used ?\n",
        "  - In Python, a lambda function is a small, anonymous function defined using the lambda keyword, typically used for short, simple operations where a full function definition is unnecessary. They are commonly used with higher-order functions like map, filter, and sorted.\n",
        "\n",
        "9. Explain the purpose and usage of the `map()` function in Python.\n",
        "  - he map() function in Python applies a given function to each item in an iterable (like a list) and returns an iterator that yields the results, effectively \"mapping\" the function across the iterable.\n",
        "\n",
        "10. What is the difference between `map()`, `reduce()`, and `filter()` functions in Python ?\n",
        "  - **map()**\n",
        "\n",
        "  - **Purpose:** Applies a function to every item in an iterable (like a list) and returns a new iterable (map object).\n",
        "  - **Syntax:** map(function, iterable)\n",
        "\n",
        "  - **ilter()**\n",
        "\n",
        "  - **Purpose:** Filters items from an iterable based on a function that returns True or False, returning a new iterable containing only the items for which the function returned True.\n",
        "  - **Syntax:** filter(function, iterable)\n",
        "\n",
        "  - **reduce()**\n",
        "\n",
        "  - **Purpose:** Applies a rolling computation to sequential pairs of values in an iterable, reducing it to a single value. It is not a built-in function in Python 3, so it must be imported from the functools module.\n",
        "  - **Syntax:** reduce(function, iterable[, initializer])"
